\subsection{Update of input measurements to recent branching ratios}
\label{sec:pdgupdate}
To make separate inputs consistent, the original measurements are 
corrected to the same up-to-date world averages of branching ratios of 

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ffwithcharmcs}
f(c \rightarrow H) = {\sigma(H)}/{\sigma(c)}. 
\end{equation}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Standard Model makes precise predictions for the total charm 
cross-section in $e^+e^-$ collisions, therefore, for those processes it 
is possible to calculate $f(c \rightarrow H)$ according to 
\eq{ffwithcharmcs}.
%
Sufficiently precise predictions for the charm-quark production 
in $pp$ and $e^{\pm}p$ collisions are not available.
%
However, making an assumption that the sum of charm-quark fragmentation 
fractions to all known weakly decaying charm hadrons is unity, the 
charm-quark fragmentation fraction to a specific hadron can be 
calculated as the ratio of the hadron-production cross-section over the 
sum of cross-sections of all known weakly decaying  charm hadrons
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ffwithsumh}
f(c\rightarrow H)={\sigma(H)}/{\Sigma_{i}\sigma(H_{i})}. 
\end{equation}
