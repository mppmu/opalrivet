\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The strong interactions  in the Standard Model are described 
with Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD) theory. 
The theory succesfully describes 
the interactions between quarks and gluons and is a source for numerous 
predictions. The verification of the QCD predictions of the QCD can
be used for the theory tunning and searches of the physics beyond the 
QCD.
One of QCD predictions that depends strongly on the theory parameters, namely on the constant of strong interaction $\alpha_s$ 
in the topology of the $e^+e^-\rightarrow hadrons$ events, i.e. multi-jet events. One of the reasons why the
topologies of the $e^+e^-\rightarrow hadrons$ events can be predicted with a high
precision is the absence of  strong interaction in the initial state. In the same tame the prediction depends on the 
centre-of-mass energy of the system and the $\alpha_s$.




This paper presents an analysis of the data obtained in $e^+e^-$ 
annihilations to hadrons in the centre-of-mass energy range 
$\sqrt{s}=91-208\GeV$. The data was obtained in the OPAL experiment 
at the LEP storage ring between 1995 and  2001. 
The measured observables are the multiplicities of the jets in the 
hadronic events obtained with various clustering procedures.

\section{Jet algorithms}
\label{sec:algorithms}
A jet clustering algorithm is a way to simplify the high energy collision event topology 
 and exibit the underlying physics at the parton level. The main goal of such a procedure is to
 reconstruct the kinematic variables of the particles produced during the primary interation.
 The energy and the momenta of the partons are reconstructed combining the 
 momenta and energy of the objects originated from the partons into jet objects.
 There are several ways, called jet algorithms,
  to perform the combination. A detailed overview of the properties can be found elsewhere.

\section{The OPAL detector}
\label{sec:detector}
{\bf Detector description is from~\cite{Abbiendi:2005eq}. Is there a standard one?}
A detailed description of the OPAL detector can be found elsewhere 
\cite{Ahmet:1990eg, Anderson:1997xwa}. Tracking of charged particles was performed by a central
detector, enclosed in a solenoid which provided a uniform axial magnetic field
of 0.435\,T.  The central detector consisted of a two-layer silicon 
microvertex detector, a high precision vertex chamber with both axial
and stereo wire layers, a large volume jet chamber providing both tracking
and ionisation energy loss information,
and additional chambers to measure the $z$ coordinate of tracks as they
left the central detector.\footnote{A right handed coordinate system is used,
with positive $z$ along the $\rm e^-$ beam direction and $x$ pointing 
towards the centre of the LEP ring. The polar and azimuthal angles are denoted
by $\theta$ and $\phi$, and the origin is taken to be the centre of the
detector.} Together these detectors provided tracking coverage for polar angles
$|\cos\theta|<0.96$, with a typical transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) 
resolution\footnote{The convention $c=1$ is used throughout this paper.} of 
$\sigma_{p_{\rm T}}/p_{\rm T}=\sqrt{(0.02)^2+(0.0015p_T)^2}$ 
with $p_{\rm T}$ measured in GeV.
The solenoid coil was surrounded by a time-of-flight counter array and 
a barrel lead-glass electromagnetic calorimeter with a presampler. Including
also the endcap electromagnetic calorimeters, the lead-glass blocks covered
the range $|\cos\theta|<0.98$ with a granularity of about $2.3^\circ$ in both
$\theta$ and $\phi$.
Outside the electromagnetic calorimetry, 
the magnet return yoke was instrumented with
streamer tubes to form a hadronic calorimeter, with angular coverage in the
range $|\cos\theta|<0.91$ and a granularity of about $5^\circ$ in $\theta$
and $7.5^\circ$ in $\phi$. The region $0.91<|\cos\theta|<0.99$ was instrumented
with an additional pole-tip hadronic calorimeter using multi-wire chambers,
having a granularity of about $4^\circ$ in $\theta$ and $11^\circ$ in $\phi$.
The detector was completed
with muon detectors outside the magnet return yoke. These were composed
of drift chambers in the barrel region and limited streamer tubes in the
endcaps, and together covered 93\,\% of the full solid angle.
The integrated luminosity was evaluated using small
angle Bhabha scattering events observed in the forward calorimeters 
\cite{Abbiendi:2003dh}.

\section{Data and Monte Carlo samples}
\label{sec:selection}
The analysis is based on the data samples obtained between 1995 and 2001 
at the centre-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}=91-208\GeV$. A summary on the luminocity
of the used samples is given in Tab.~\ref{tab:luminocity}.
\TABluminocity


For the background estimation and detector corrections the Monte Carlo samples 
produced with Pythia6, Herwig, Ariadne and KoralW~\cite{Skrzypek:1995wd} generators 
and passed throught OPAL detector simulation were used.
A short overview of the used Monte Carlo samples is given in Tab.~\ref{tab:montecarlo}.
\TABmontecarlo


\subsection{Event selection}
\label{sec:selection}
The performed event selection is similar to one used in Ref.~\cite{}.

A minimum five tracks were required in the event.
The events were required to have $|\cos\theta|<0.95$, where the  
$\theta|$ is the polar angle of the thrust axis calculated from all track
and cluster objects.

To reject the background event the cuts on the probaility of $w$ were applied.
The formae is calculated accordingly to the Ref.~.






\subsection{Event reconstruction}
\label{sec:reconstruction}
For the selected events the reconstruction procedure was performed.
The input for the reconstruction procedure for the Monte Carlo generator events
was a set of partons.
The input for the reconstruction procedure on the (simulated)detector level
 was a set of tracks and the electromagnetic calorimeter clusters.
To avoid the double counting of the clustered objects on the detector level the energy-flow 
algorithm~\cite{Ackerstaff:1997nga,Abbiendi:1999sy}, that matched tracks to the 
 clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter was applied. Therefore each 
 matched pair of track and cluster was replaced with a combined object.
 {\bf I would do so, it is the best solution. But what they did is not clear. Ask Stefan.}

For each event the event shape variables~\cite{OPAL:2011aa} 
were calculated  as  implemented in Rivet package~\cite{Buckley:2010ar}.

The jet rates were obtained with the Durham~\cite{Catani:1991hj}, SiScone~\cite{Cacciari:2005hq}, anti-kt~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp}, Jade~\cite{Bartel:1986ua}
  and Cambridge-Aahen~\cite{Dokshitzer:1997in}
clustering algorithms as implemented in FastJet~\cite{Cacciari:2011ma}.
% for the data and reconstructed events.

The parameters of the clustering procedures are given in Tab.~\ref{tab:algorithms}.
\TABalgorithms

The measured distributions of the jet rates were obtained in the following way.
To take into account the presence of $e^-e^+ \rightarrow llqq$ events in the 
obtained detector level distribution the background subtraction procedure was performed.
The simulated detector level distributions of the $e^-e^+ \rightarrow llqq$ events 
weighted to the same luminocity were subtracted from the detector level distributions.
The obtained distributions were corrected bin by bin to the detector effects. 
The corrections were obtained as a ratio of 
the simulated detector level distributions of the $e^-e^+ \rightarrow llqq$ events 
and the generator level distributions of the same events.
Finaly the distributions were normalized to the number of weighted entries.

The Figs.~\ref{fig:example}\ref{fig:example}\ref{fig:example}\ref{fig:example}
present the obtained distributions for the studied clustering algorithms.

\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:systematic}
It was assumed the
 systematic uncertainties on the obtained results 
 had the several sources.

 To take into account a limited quality of Monte Carlo simulation of the
 QCD processes, the Pythia Monte Carlo simulated event sample used for the detector
 corrction was replaced with one produced with Herwig.
 The uncertsainty of the background modelig was estimated by varying the 
 background amount by $\pm5\%$.
To take into account a limited efficiencly of the energy-flow 
algorithm the same reconstruction was performed without it.
 To take into acount the influence of selection procedure
the background rejection cuts described in Sec.~\ref{sec:selection}. % independantly.
 The actual values of the independantly performed variations are shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:cutvariations}.
 \TABcutvariations
 
The differences between the reference distributions and the distributions obtained with 
the variation procedure were bin-by-bin added in quadratures resulting the systematic uncertainty for 
every bin of the reference distribution.
 
% For each quantity  the  pair of cut changes to lower and higher value considering as one variation.

\section{Comparison to the previous measurements}                      
\label{sec:comparison}
The previous measurements of the jet rates were performed on the LEP by 
the OPAL, DELPHI, ALEPH and L3 experiments~\cite{Alexander:1996kh,
Ackerstaff:1997kk,Acton:1992fa,Akrawy:1989rg,Heister:2003aj,Abdallah:2003xz,Achard:2004sv}.

\section{Summary}                      
\label{sec:summary}
The jet rate observables  in $e^+e^-$ 
annihilations to hadrons were measured with various clustering procedures.
The new results obtained with 
clustering algorithms  used earlier agree with the previously published measurements.
The results obtained with the recently developed clustering algorithms  
provide an input for the validation of QCD and precise estimation of its parameters.
