Example:\cite{Besson:2007aa}



This paper presents an analysis of the data obtained in $e^+e^-$ 
annihilations to hadrons in the centre-of-mass energy range 
$\sqrt{s}=91-208\GeV$. The data was obtained in the OPAL experiment 
at the LEP storage ring between 1995 and  2001. 
The measured observables are the multiplicities of the jets in the 
hadronic events obtained with various clustering procedures.
