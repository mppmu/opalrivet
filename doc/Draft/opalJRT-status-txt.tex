\begin{itemize}
\item {Possible options for  the final script (non-exclusive list):
\begin{itemize}
\item (Yes) arXiv note;
\item (Yes) DESY note;
\item (Yes) Journal article/letter (JHEP?EPJC?);
\item (Desirable?) PDG note;
\item (Desirable) PDG table.
\end{itemize}
An arXiv note or DESY note doesn't restrict the format of the writings, and, perhaps could be done anyway.
For a journal article/letter the journal the submission destination should be picked. I don't have much experience with it.
The most interesting options,   a PDG table or note, the authors of quark properties sections in  PDG should be contacted/informed about
 the available results.
